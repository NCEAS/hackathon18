## Goal

Estimate the local economic impacts of NCEAS through its activities and scientists visinting NCEAS.

## Problem

- This information is split across 2 systems
- We need this information for reporting
- Help to find who hasnâ€™t yet submitted reimbursements

- Think about if/how to capture resident $$ - rent we pay for the building, jobs created for resident folks, etc. 
- How much money are visitors infusing into the SB economy? Where is it being spent?
- Split out by food/travel/hotel
- Map of where people are visiting from
reimbursements
- Open to additional ideas & visualizations!
