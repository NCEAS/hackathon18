## Timeline

To help with the event and be sure teams are exchanging and brainstorming, we would like to set few milestones for our hackathon. Suggested agenda:

1. Short presentations about the 2 projects (20min)
2. Data exploration
3. Workflow development
4. Implementation
5. Reporting (20min)

## Collaborative

We will work in teams of 3-4 participants. We hope we can create team in an organic way, but we might have to randomly assign people for time constrain reasons. 

We would like to promote few approaches to foster collaboration inspired from [mob programming](https://github.com/R-Meetup-SB/hackathon-201806/blob/master/mob-programming.md):

- One laptop per team (3-4 persons)
- One person is typing, the other members are instructing what to code


## Inclusive

Please be inclusive of your teammates independently of their coding level and favorite programming language (or lack of). Welcome, encourage, listen and discuss all people contributions to the final product of your team. Moreover have fun!
