```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

You will need to install the `googlesheets` and authorize your Google account to allow `R` to access your data. 


Read in data:

```{r libraries}
library(googlesheets) # install.packages('googlesheets')
library(tidyverse)

```

This only works if the data is in a google drive, not team drive. We'll do that next.

```{r read in data}
## authorize googledocs -- requires user interaction with default browser
gs_auth(new_user = TRUE) 

#### read in Google Sheets ----
master_list <-  googlesheets::gs_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FZJUZLIvcEfg3Wx4MO4ilCs5zi1A08qui4cJyPs1nbk/edit#gid=0") %>% 
  googlesheets::gs_read()   
head(master_list)
```
